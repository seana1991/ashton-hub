## Feb 25, 2026 - Mobile Access Mystery (UNSOLVED)

**Confirmed:** Site IS live (bottom-nav, 95KB, cache-busting works)
**Problem:** Sean cannot access from mobile - sees old version even with:
- Hard refresh
- Private mode  
- Different browsers (Edge, DuckDuckGo)
- Tailscale off
- Cache-busting URLs
- Old URL same issue

**Theory:** Network-level DNS/cache issue on Sean's mobile carrier
